Imagine that everywhere you touched a post-it with your
passwords would appear. Imagine that your government and the governments in
many of the countries you've travelled to had all your passwords. Imagine that
governments weren't that good at protecting your
[passwords](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/philippine_voter_data_breach/).
In the day and age of Touch ID and other technologies that use your fingerprints as
passwords you don't have to imagine.

Our fingerprints are akin to usernames not passwords. We only have 10 of them and they cannot be changed when a breach occurs. We spread
them everywhere we touch and there are databases containing them. Databases that get lost,
stolen, and leaked. We can be forced to use our fingerprints.
This is why you should disable Touch ID and any similar technology.

> Remember to change your fingerprints regularly and never use the same on several websites.

## Convenience

Often security and convenience sit at opposite ends of the scale. Rarely is something both very
convenient and secure. By nature a lot of security is not convenient and sometimes we need to trade
some degree of convenience in favour of security. In the case of fingerprints it's very convenient to
unlock your phone or authenticate App Store purchases with only the touch of your finger. With fingerprint
authentication we are trading security for convenience.

When I first got my iPhone 6s I was really impressed by the speed
and precision of Touch ID, but as I used the phone more I came to realise that I was trading too much security
for my convenience. I've since switched back to using a trusted 6 digit pin. I will switch to a full alphanumeric
passphrase at some point. Entering a 6 digit pin is not at all as convenient as touching a sensor, but it's more
secure.

Pin codes and passphrases suffer from their own category of security issues, someone looking over your shoulder
being the most significant one. In fact when Touch ID was first released this was a point that was made.

Touch ID definitely features a more secure input method than pins. However one should remember that
the input in the case of Touch ID isn't a **password**, it's a **username**.

## So should you disable Touch ID?

Ultimately it comes down to where you stand on the tradeoff on security and convenience. Is it
worth it to trade a sizeable chunk of security for a more convenient way to unlock your phone?
I have given you my opinion, but deciding on the tradeoff is stil up to each and everyone of us.

**Just remember:**

> Fingerprints are not **passwords**. They are **usernames**.
